```

---

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Pattern**: Clean Architecture (Data/Domain/Presentation)
- **State**: Provider pattern
- **Caching**: Repository-level with 5-minute TTL
- **Security**: RLS + UI restrictions

### Key Features

**FacultyRepository**
- Fetches faculty with user data joins
- Smart caching for performance
- Search and filter operations
- Department listing
- Profile updates

**FacultyProvider**
- Manages faculty list state
- Search and filter logic
- Department grouping
- Loading/error states
- Real-time filtering

**UI Components**
- List: Searchable, filterable faculty directory
- Detail: Full profile with contact actions
- Edit: Form with validation for profile updates

### Data Flow
```
UI → Provider → Repository → Supabase → PostgreSQL
                   ↓
                 Cache
```
