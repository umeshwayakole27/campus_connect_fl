# üó∫Ô∏è Map Location Button Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Location Button ‚úÖ
**Problem**: There were TWO location buttons on the map:
- Google Maps' built-in location button (top right)
- Custom floating action button (bottom right)

**Solution**: 
- Removed the custom duplicate button
- Enabled Google's built-in location button which is more reliable
- Google's button automatically handles permissions and location updates

### 2. "My Location" Button Doesn't Move Camera ‚úÖ
**Problem**: When clicking the location button, it would get the user's location but sometimes wouldn't move the camera to that position.

**Solution**:
- Created a new dedicated method `_moveToMyLocation()` that:
  - Gets the current location
  - Shows feedback message "Getting your location..."
  - Waits for the map controller to be ready
  - Animates the camera to the user's location with proper zoom (18x)
  - Handles all errors gracefully

### 3. Better User Experience ‚úÖ
**Changes Made**:
- Google's built-in location button now shows at top right corner
- Single tap immediately centers on your location
- Smooth camera animation to user position
- Zoom level set to 18 for better detail view
- Disabled zoom controls to reduce clutter
- Only shows "Clear Route" button when actively navigating
