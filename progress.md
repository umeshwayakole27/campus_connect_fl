### Database Schema Design:

#### 1. users Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('student', 'faculty')),
  profile_pic TEXT,
  department TEXT,
  office TEXT,
  office_hours TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW()),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW())
);
```

#### 2. events Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  location TEXT,
  location_id UUID REFERENCES campus_locations(id),
  time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
  created_by UUID REFERENCES users(id) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW()),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW())
);
```

#### 3. faculty Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE faculty (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  department TEXT NOT NULL,
  office TEXT,
  office_hours TEXT,
  contact_email TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW()),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW())
);
```

#### 4. campus_locations Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE campus_locations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  building_code TEXT,
  lat DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
  lng DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW())
);
```

#### 5. notifications Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE notifications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  event_id UUID REFERENCES events(id),
  type TEXT NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  sent_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW()),
  read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
```

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies:

#### Users Table RLS
```sql
-- Users can read their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile"
ON users FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Users can update their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile"
ON users FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

#### Events Table RLS
```sql
-- Everyone can view events
CREATE POLICY "Everyone can view events"
ON events FOR SELECT
USING (true);

-- Only faculty can create events
CREATE POLICY "Faculty can create events"
ON events FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  auth.uid() IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE role = 'faculty')
);

-- Only faculty who created can update/delete
CREATE POLICY "Faculty can update own events"
ON events FOR UPDATE
USING (
  auth.uid() = created_by AND
  auth.uid() IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE role = 'faculty')
);

CREATE POLICY "Faculty can delete own events"
ON events FOR DELETE
USING (
  auth.uid() = created_by AND
  auth.uid() IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE role = 'faculty')
);
```

#### Notifications Table RLS
```sql
-- Users can view their own notifications
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own notifications"
ON notifications FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Only faculty can create notifications
CREATE POLICY "Faculty can create notifications"
ON notifications FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  auth.uid() IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE role = 'faculty')
);
```

#### Faculty Table RLS
```sql
-- Everyone can view faculty
CREATE POLICY "Everyone can view faculty"
ON faculty FOR SELECT
USING (true);

-- Only the faculty member can update their own info
CREATE POLICY "Faculty can update own info"
ON faculty FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

#### Campus Locations Table RLS
```sql
-- Everyone can view locations
CREATE POLICY "Everyone can view campus locations"
ON campus_locations FOR SELECT
USING (true);

-- Only faculty can manage locations (optional)
CREATE POLICY "Faculty can manage locations"
ON campus_locations FOR ALL
USING (
  auth.uid() IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE role = 'faculty')
);
```

### Notes:
- All RLS policies enforce role-based access control
- Faculty role grants additional privileges for event and notification management
- Students have read-only access to most data
- User profiles are private and only accessible by the owner

### Next Steps:
1. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
2. Create complete directory structure
3. Set up Supabase project in dashboard
4. Execute SQL schema creation
5. Configure environment variables
6. Initialize Supabase in Flutter app

Last Updated: 2024 - Phase 3 In Progress (Map Troubleshooting)

---

## 🚨 Current Issue: Google Maps Not Displaying

### Problem Description:
- Map shows only Google logo in bottom left corner
- No map tiles loading
- Campus locations not visible

### Troubleshooting Steps Completed:
1. ✅ Updated campus center coordinates to GECA Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar (19.8680502, 75.3241057)
2. ✅ Replaced dummy Google Maps API key with real key in AndroidManifest.xml
3. ✅ Verified API key: AIzaSyCc2AHZNmWl19wWtNqfYQRleBlbwnrpN6M
4. ✅ Rebuilt app with flutter clean
5. ✅ App successfully installs and runs on Android device

### Next Debugging Steps Required:
1. **Verify Google Maps API Key is enabled for:**
   - Maps SDK for Android
   - Maps SDK for iOS (if needed)
   - Places API (if using places)
   
2. **Check API Key Restrictions:**
   - Go to Google Cloud Console
   - Navigate to APIs & Services > Credentials
   - Select your API key
   - Ensure Android app restriction allows package: com.campus_connect.geca
   - Add SHA-1 certificate fingerprint if required
   
3. **Get SHA-1 Certificate:**
   ```bash
   cd android
   ./gradlew signingReport
   # Copy SHA-1 from debug variant
   # Add to Google Cloud Console API key restrictions
   ```

4. **Enable Required APIs in Google Cloud:**
   - Maps SDK for Android
   - Geocoding API (optional, for address search)
   - Places API (optional, for place search)

5. **Check Supabase Data:**
   - Verify campus_locations table has data
   - Run SQL: `SELECT * FROM campus_locations;`
   - Should show 14 GECA locations

6. **Monitor Logs:**
   - Check for specific Google Maps errors
   - Look for network/permission issues
   - Verify location permissions granted on device

### Files Modified for Map Fix:
- `/lib/features/campus_map/presentation/campus_map_screen.dart` - Updated campus center coordinates
- `/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Added real Google Maps API key

### Expected Behavior After Fix:
- Map should center on GECA campus (19.8680502, 75.3241057)
- 14 location markers should be visible
- Category filter should work
- Tapping markers should show location details
