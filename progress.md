### Database Schema Design:

#### 1. users Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('student', 'faculty')),
  profile_pic TEXT,
  department TEXT,
  office TEXT,
  office_hours TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW()),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW())
);
```

#### 2. events Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  location TEXT,
  location_id UUID REFERENCES campus_locations(id),
  time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
  created_by UUID REFERENCES users(id) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW()),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW())
);
```

#### 3. faculty Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE faculty (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  department TEXT NOT NULL,
  office TEXT,
  office_hours TEXT,
  contact_email TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW()),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW())
);
```

#### 4. campus_locations Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE campus_locations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  building_code TEXT,
  lat DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
  lng DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW())
);
```

#### 5. notifications Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE notifications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  event_id UUID REFERENCES events(id),
  type TEXT NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  sent_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc', NOW()),
  read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
```

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies:

#### Users Table RLS
```sql
-- Users can read their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile"
ON users FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Users can update their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile"
ON users FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

#### Events Table RLS
```sql
-- Everyone can view events
CREATE POLICY "Everyone can view events"
ON events FOR SELECT
USING (true);

-- Only faculty can create events
CREATE POLICY "Faculty can create events"
ON events FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  auth.uid() IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE role = 'faculty')
);

-- Only faculty who created can update/delete
CREATE POLICY "Faculty can update own events"
ON events FOR UPDATE
USING (
  auth.uid() = created_by AND
  auth.uid() IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE role = 'faculty')
);

CREATE POLICY "Faculty can delete own events"
ON events FOR DELETE
USING (
  auth.uid() = created_by AND
  auth.uid() IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE role = 'faculty')
);
```

#### Notifications Table RLS
```sql
-- Users can view their own notifications
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own notifications"
ON notifications FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Only faculty can create notifications
CREATE POLICY "Faculty can create notifications"
ON notifications FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  auth.uid() IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE role = 'faculty')
);
```

#### Faculty Table RLS
```sql
-- Everyone can view faculty
CREATE POLICY "Everyone can view faculty"
ON faculty FOR SELECT
USING (true);

-- Only the faculty member can update their own info
CREATE POLICY "Faculty can update own info"
ON faculty FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

#### Campus Locations Table RLS
```sql
-- Everyone can view locations
CREATE POLICY "Everyone can view campus locations"
ON campus_locations FOR SELECT
USING (true);

-- Only faculty can manage locations (optional)
CREATE POLICY "Faculty can manage locations"
ON campus_locations FOR ALL
USING (
  auth.uid() IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE role = 'faculty')
);
```

### Notes:
- All RLS policies enforce role-based access control
- Faculty role grants additional privileges for event and notification management
- Students have read-only access to most data
- User profiles are private and only accessible by the owner

### Next Steps:
1. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
2. Create complete directory structure
3. Set up Supabase project in dashboard
4. Execute SQL schema creation
5. Configure environment variables
6. Initialize Supabase in Flutter app
