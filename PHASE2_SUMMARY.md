## 📱 Application Flow

### Authentication Flow
```
App Start
    ↓
Check Auth State
    ↓
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│  Authenticated  │ Not Authenticated│
└────────┬────────┴────────┬─────────┘
         ↓                 ↓
    Home Page        Login Screen
         │                 │
         │         ┌───────┴───────┐
         │         │               │
         │    Register      Forgot Password
         │         │               │
