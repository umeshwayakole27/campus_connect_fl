# 🗺️ Map Location Button - FINAL FIX

## ✅ What's Fixed Now

### Your Request:
1. ❌ Remove the duplicate button at **top right** (Google's built-in one)
2. ✅ Keep the custom **"My Location"** button at **bottom right**
3. ✅ Make it immediately take you to YOUR current location when tapped

### Solution Implemented:
- ✅ Disabled Google Maps' built-in location button (`myLocationButtonEnabled: false`)
- ✅ Custom "My Location" FAB remains at **bottom right corner**
- ✅ Button now calls `_moveToMyLocation()` which:
  - Gets your GPS coordinates
  - Shows "Getting your location..." message
  - Smoothly animates camera to YOUR position
  - Zooms to street level (18x zoom)
  - Shows blue dot at your exact location
